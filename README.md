# Visualizations & Insights

In this reposiory, you will see a sample file of the different visualizations & insights would look like. These are showcase-wide observations instead of each specific team, as those are covered in the scouting reports not on GitHub. Although we used Python in 2022, you can use any language so long as it is able to generate the visualization that you are looking for using the data. 

In the future, we hope to use some statistical inference methods when conducting the insights from the visualizations. Doing this gives quantitative reasoning for the insights that are made from the showcase.
